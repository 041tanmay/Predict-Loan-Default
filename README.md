# 💳 Loan Default Prediction Using Machine Learning

Welcome to my project on **Loan Default Prediction**, where we use machine learning to predict whether a borrower will default on a loan based on their financial profile. This project is developed as part of my academic coursework and helps in understanding real-world applications of classification models.

## 📌 Problem Statement

In the financial world, predicting loan default is crucial for minimizing risks and ensuring stability.  
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can **classify** whether a person will **default** on a loan or not using features such as income, credit score, employment status, etc.

## 🔍 Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values by dropping them for simplicity.
   - Encoded categorical features using `LabelEncoder`.

2. **Model Building**
   - Applied `RandomForestClassifier` for classification.
   - Split the dataset into train (80%) and test (20%).

3. **Evaluation**
   - Evaluated the model using:
     - ✅ Accuracy
     - 🎯 Precision
     - 📢 Recall
   - Created a confusion matrix heatmap for visual insights.
